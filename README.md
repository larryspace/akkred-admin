# Abwise UI


Front side Abwise application.

### Tech

We use:

* [React] - A javascript library for building user interfaces
* [React-Router] - Declarative routing for React
* [Redux] - Predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
* [Material-UI] - Material-UI A Set of React Components that Implement Google's Material Design
* [Webpack] - A bundler for javascript
* [Yarn] - Fast, reliable, and secure dependency management

And many other libraries.

### Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v6+ and [Yarn] to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ git clone https://lab.wienerdeming.com/myjob/admin.git
$ cd admin
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

### Testing
In this moment we don't have any test but you can run lint for same issue
```sh 
$ yarn run lint

Another use case write hook for git like this

```
before push check lint automatic
